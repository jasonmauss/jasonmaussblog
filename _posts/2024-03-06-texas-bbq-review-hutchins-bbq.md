During my latest Texas trip to the Dallas / Fort Worth area (or "DFW", or "The Metroplex" as the locals say) I decided to give [Hutchins BBQ](https://hutchinsbbq.com/frisco-menu) a try. I arrived at their Frisco location around 5:45, fortunately in time to beat the dinner rush. Their peak busy time in the evening causes the line to back up all the way out the doors and into the parking lot, which I noticed as I exited to head back to my hotel room.
