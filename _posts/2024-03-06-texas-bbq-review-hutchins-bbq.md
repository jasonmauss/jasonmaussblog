During my latest Texas trip to the Dallas / Fort Worth area (or "DFW", or "The Metroplex" as the locals say) I decided to give [Hutchins BBQ](https://hutchinsbbq.com/frisco-menu) a try. I arrived at their Frisco location around 5:45, fortunately in time to beat the dinner rush. Their peak busy time in the evening causes the line to back up all the way out the doors and into the parking lot, which I noticed as I exited to head back to my hotel room. A line like that didn't surprise me, given the quality of what I had just finished eating.

In my experience with Texas BBQ restaurants so far, I've come to realize that the smell of smoked meat should hit your nose well in advance of you entering the doors and Hutchins definitely checked that box. I also enjoyed looking at the scribble graffiti all over the walls inside that contributed to the feeling that visiting Hutchins BBQ was a rite of passage for those that had visited there before me. Visitors names, which states they had travelled from, and in which year appeared all over the walls, windows and pretty much any surface they could reach.
