Amidst the resounding echoes of critics asserting that "Tennis can't get out of its own way", a sentiment oft-repeated by sports journalists and those entrenched in the sport's coverage, the saga of professional tennis unfolds. Spanning 55 years since the inauguration of "The Open Era" in 1968, tennis has organically ascended to claim its place as the fourth most popular global sport, boasting a dedicated following of a billion fans. Yet, beneath the veneer of this success, a paradox lingers. Despite over five decades of professional competition, the majority of tennis professionals find the path to a sustainable livelihood rather arduous. As both a player and an avid fan, I thought I'd weigh in on this conundrum, offering some of my thoughts on how the sport can chart a course toward a more prosperous future for players, fans, and the sport at large. A discussion on this topic wouldn't be complete without some thoughts on the recently announced [OneVision](https://onevision.atptour.com/onevision/) initiative by the ATP and the [PTPA](https://www.ptpaplayers.com/) also, so I'll give my thoughts on those as well since they are working towards improving the aspects of tennis I discuss here.

### My tennis background and perspective

Ever since my teenage years in the mid-1990s, I've been playing recreationally and following the world of pro tennis, captivated by the era of legends like Lendl, Edberg, Becker, Sampras, and Agassi. In those early days, my tennis universe revolved around watching matches and highlights when they were nationally televised. No cable TV meant mostly following the four majors and keeping tabs on who claimed the coveted titles.

As a young adult paying for my own cable TV package, I was watching tennis on TV as often as I could (sometimes ruining my sleep schedule over two weeks) and began following the sport and players much closer. My frequent playing resulted in breaking strings often enough that I decided to buy my own electronic stringing machine and taught myself how to restring racquets to save some money long-term. This perfunctory cost-savings decision was actually one that would end up having a huge impact on my level of involvement in the sport later in my life (stories for another time). 

As more information about players, tournaments, and the business side of the sport gradually trickled on to the internet I was surprised about some of what I was learning. Perhaps even more surprising is that not much has changed in the twenty years since then, which at the time already had decades of the status quo making up the sport's history.

While I have a laundry list of improvements I think tennis could make, I'll focus on these for now:

* Lopsided Prize Money
* The Single-elimination value proposition
* Player Unionization / Representation
* Support for developing talent

Let's get into it. Also, I love to hear from readers what they think, so feel free to leave your comments at the bottom of the page.

### Prize Money: The status quo has to go

In the realm of professional sports, be it team-based or individual, a pronounced income disparity prevails among players. The *superstars* of the sports world can amass earnings ten, twenty, or even fifty times greater than their colleagues, especially when factoring in income from sponsorships and other non-salary streams. In the context of tennis, the phenomenon of top-ranked and highly popular players out-earning their lower-ranked counterparts isn't inherently problematic from a financial perspective.

However, where tennis faces a critical financial challenge lies in the distribution of prize money at tournaments. It's here that a nuanced examination is warranted. A more equitable—dare I say, *fair*—allocation of the prize money pool could significantly enhance the sport. Such an approach would not only democratize access to crucial resources like coaching, training, and career development, but also holds the potential to extend the longevity of players' careers. By fostering a more inclusive financial landscape, tennis can ensure that the benefits of success are shared more broadly, creating a sustainable and thriving ecosystem for all its participants.

For my example, I'm using a decent size professional tennis tournament. Not one of the four majors, but one of the bigger tournaments - Indian Wells. In the table below is the prize money structure for the 2023 Indian Wells men's singles draw, and how I would structure the prize money if it were up to me. *I would also increase the share of revenue that tournaments are required to share with the players via prize money, but that's a whole other topic*. While I'm only using men's singles as an example here the same redistribution percentages could be applied to prize money for women's tennis, doubles, etc. 

#### 2023 BNP Paribas Open Men's Singles (Indian Wells)

It's important to keep in mind the percentages as well as how many players get eliminated each round (receiving the same payout) and what percentage of the prize money that the payouts for that round's losing players represents. I've included it all in this breakdown to hopefully show how absurdly lopsided the earnings are at the top.

The total prize money available on the men's side (as well as the women's) in 2023 was $8,800,000. A portion of that goes to doubles teams so the total prize money going towards singles competition was **$6,857,990**.

Certain figures in the table above show just *how much* tennis rewards their champions at the expense of the rest of the field. The current distribution of prize money:
* Awards the champion roughly *twice* what it awards the opponent they defeated in the final. So double the financial reward for winning just one more match. In fact, the champion could potentially win fewer points in that match, but still receive double the prize money.
* Awards the champion as much as the runner-up as well as the combined sum given to all 32 players that lost their first round matches.
* Awards just one person (the champion) 18.4 percent of the total prize money purse in an event where nearly 100 players entered the main draw.
* Awards the champion a larger share of the prize money than any other round of the tournament by far. The champion receives $1.26M while all 32 players that lose in the second round collectively receive $987,550.

In the columns to the right where I've laid out what my take on the prize money distribution could be, you see:
* Players that lose in qualifying (likely younger players still developing, or players coming back from injury) receive roughly double the current amount.
* The Champion still receives the largest check of anyone, but it's only 9.2% of the total purse compared to the 7.2% the runner-up receives. Not double the amount, but enough to make a meaningful difference.
* The slight decreases in prize money going to the Quarterfinalists and Semifinalists helps fund more meaningful payouts to the players losing in rounds 1 - 4. Keep in mind that typically (not always, but regularly) the players making the quarterfinals and beyond in any given tournament are reaching the later rounds in most of the tournaments they play in. This means they will still be repeatedly earning larger prize money sums than their lower-ranked peers for better performance. A lot of those players earn money from sponsorships, playing exhibitions during the off-season and bonus payouts. In some cases, appearance fees as well.
