Amidst the resounding echoes of critics asserting that "Tennis can't get out of its own way", a sentiment oft-repeated by sports journalists and those entrenched in the sport's coverage, the saga of professional tennis unfolds. Spanning 55 years since the inauguration of "The Open Era" in 1968, tennis has organically ascended to claim its place as the fourth most popular global sport, boasting a dedicated following of a billion fans. Yet, beneath the veneer of this success, a paradox lingers. Despite over five decades of professional competition, the majority of tennis professionals find the path to a sustainable livelihood rather arduous. As both a player and an avid fan, I thought I'd weigh in on this conundrum, offering some of my thoughts on how the sport can chart a course toward a more prosperous future for players, fans, and the sport at large. A discussion on this topic wouldn't be complete without some thoughts on the [PTPA](https://www.ptpaplayers.com/) also, so I'll give my thoughts on that as well.

### The status quo has to go

Every major professional sport, whether it's comprised of teams or individuals, has some disparity among how much each player earns. The *superstars* in team sports can make ten, twenty, or even fifty times as much as their teammates especially if you factor in earnings from sponsorships and other non-salary income. For tennis to have it's top-ranked and most popular players earning more than their lower ranked, less popular peers is not one of the financial aspects of tennis that I have a problem with. However, the distribution of prize money for tournaments could really stand to have some more thought given to it. A more even (I'd say *fair*) distribution of the prize money pool could go a long way to make the same coaching, training and career resources available to more players and even potentially increase the longevity of players careers. Here's the prize money structure for some men's tournaments, and how I would structure the winnings if it were up to me. *I would also increase the share of revenue that tournaments are required to share with the players via prize money, but that's a whole other topic*. While I'm only using men's singles as an example here the same redistribution percentages could apply to prize money for women's tennis, doubles, etc.
