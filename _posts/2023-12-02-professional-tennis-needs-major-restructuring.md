Amidst the resounding echoes of critics asserting that "Tennis can't get out of its own way", a sentiment oft-repeated by sports journalists and those entrenched in the sport's coverage, the saga of professional tennis unfolds. Spanning 55 years since the inauguration of "The Open Era" in 1968, tennis has organically ascended to claim its place as the fourth most popular global sport, boasting a dedicated following of a billion fans. Yet, beneath the veneer of this success, a paradox lingers. Despite over five decades of professional competition, the majority of tennis professionals find the path to a sustainable livelihood rather arduous. As both a player and an avid fan, I thought I'd weigh in on this conundrum, offering some of my thoughts on how the sport can chart a course toward a more prosperous future for players, fans, and the sport at large. A discussion on this topic wouldn't be complete without some thoughts on the [PTPA](https://www.ptpaplayers.com/) also, so I'll give my thoughts on that as well.

### My tennis background and perspective

I've been involved in tennis as a fan and player since my teenage years which, for me was the mid 1990's. The hey-day of players like Lendl, Edberg, Becker, Sampras, Agassi and their contemporaries. As a young fan, my sphere of interest didn't include much beyond watching matches or highlights when they were nationally televised. No cable TV in the house meant watching the four majors and having some idea of which players had recently taken home the titles.

As a young adult paying for my own cable TV package, I was watching tennis on TV as often as I could (sometimes ruining my sleep schedule over two weeks) and began following the sport and players much closer. I was also playing often and breaking strings so I bought my own electronic stringing machine and taught myself how to restring racquets to save some money long-term. This perfunctory cost-savings decision was actually one that would end up having a huge impact on my level of involvement in the sport later in my life (stories for another time). As more information about players, tournaments, and the business side of the sport gradually trickled on to the internet I was surprised about some of what I was learning. Perhaps even more surprising is that not much has changed in the twenty years since then, which at the time already had decades of the status quo making up the sports history.

While I have a laundry list of improvements I think tennis could make, I'll focus on these for now:

* Lopsided Prize Money
* The Single-elimination value proposition
* Player Unionization / Representation
* Support for developing talent

Let's get into it. Also, I love to hear from readers what they think, so feel free to leave your comments at the bottom of the page.

### Prize Money: The status quo has to go

Every major professional sport, whether it's teams or individuals, has some disparity among how much each player earns. The *superstars* in pro sports can make ten, twenty, or even fifty times as much as their colleagues, especially if you factor in earnings from sponsorships and other non-salary income. For tennis to have it's top-ranked and most popular players earning more than their lower ranked, less popular peers is not one of the financial aspects of tennis that I have a problem with. However, the distribution of prize money for tournaments could really stand to have some more thought given to it. A more even (I'd say *fair*) distribution of the prize money pool could go a long way to make the same coaching, training and career resources available to more players and even potentially increase the longevity of players careers.

For my example, I'm using a decent size professional tennis tournament. Not one of the four majors, but one of the bigger tournaments - Indian Wells. In the table below is the prize money structure for the 2023 Indian Wells men's singles draw, and how I would structure the prize money if it were up to me. *I would also increase the share of revenue that tournaments are required to share with the players via prize money, but that's a whole other topic*. While I'm only using men's singles as an example here the same redistribution percentages could be applied to prize money for women's tennis, doubles, etc. 

#### 2023 BNP Paribas Open Men's Singles (Indian Wells)

It's important to keep in mind the percentages as well as how many players get eliminated each round and receive the same payout and what piece of the prize money pie that represents. So I've included it all.

The total prize money available was $8,800,000. A portion of that goes to doubles teams so the total prize money going towards singles competition was **$6,857,990**.
