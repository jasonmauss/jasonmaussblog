As soon as the clock expired on the NFC Championship game between the Detroit Lions and my San Francisco 49ers, I was already thinking about what kind of BBQ I was going to make for the big game in two weeks time. On my third subsequent trip to Costco, I finally found a brisket that had a decently thick flat and didn't weigh north of 20 pounds. During another grocery shopping trip I found some baby back ribs that looked good and were on sale at quite a good price so I pulled the trigger on those as well. Brisket and ribs - and a macaroni and cheese my wife was making - were plenty for me since I'm trying to eat better these days and this was a "cheat day" for me so I didn't want to overdo it on calories, or sodium!

While the choice grade brisket I bought had some decent marbling, it was pretty fatty too. After some aggressive trimming with my new [Dexter 6" boning knife](https://amzn.to/3wfh2Dg) that I got for Christmas, I seasoned the brisket with [my new favorite BBQ Brisket rub](https://amzn.to/3wpCdSR), and put it on the smoker around 10 am Saturday morning. One of my goals was to be done prepping food by at least a couple of hours before game time. I fired up the smoker with [my favorite pellets](https://amzn.to/3SYmaUZ) as well as getting a couple of [smoke tubes](https://amzn.to/3SZRwus) in the cook chamber for increased smoky flavor on the brisket. About 12 hours later the brisket was done, and after letting the internal temp drop to about 165F, I held it in my oven at 150F until it was time to slice it up the following day. It turned out to be one of the best briskets I've smoked - it was very juicy, tender, and I managed to keep the flat from drying out as well.

The baby back ribs were much easier on all counts - hardly any trimming needed, and I only cooked them for about 4 hours at 300F. After 3 hours, I foil wrapped them after generously applying a glaze I made from brown sugar, manuka honey, onion powder, paprika, and a spicy mop sauce I had in the fridge. They turned out great. Juicy tender meat that didn't fall off the bone, but came off easily once you bit into it - just the way I like it.

## Let down by the game, but not by the food

Despite my 49ers losing the Super Bowl to the Chiefs in an overtime thriller of a game (UGH!! Moody we needed that PAT!) at least the food tasted great and we got to enjoy it with good company.
