As 2023 starts winding down and we reach the time of year when some of my favorite holidays are on the calendar, my wife and I sat down to plan our Thanksgiving meal. My family has never really been huge fans of the  conventional turkey and common sides you see at most American Thanksgiving spreads - although we have celebrated that way a few times. I of course, being me, offered to make some delicious smokey BBQ meats and try my hand at a banana pudding recipe. Lucky for me, she agreed! I thought it might also be fun to memorialize the occasion by writing about it and sharing some photos so here I am doing just that.

### The Full Menu

With my kids getting older and leaving the nest, I figure there might be a limited number of times left where we're all living close enough to be able to get together on Thanksgiving, so might as well go big while everyone can enjoy it. Here's what I was in charge of:

* Beef Brisket
* Pulled Pork with Hog Sauce (and a South Carolina mustard bbq sauce)
* Pork Spare Ribs
* Jalapeno Cheddar Sausage
* Rhodes Yeast Dinner Rolls (easy to toss in the oven)
* Cinnamon roll banana pudding (my first attempt)

Some other items that made the menu that I didn't have to prepare

* Mac & Cheese w/ panko topping
* Mashed Potatoes (mix of red & Yukon gold)
* Fruit Salad
* Sweet Potato Casserole

Some of these dishes don't take that long at all to prepare, while others (like some of the meats) take an entire day - at least with the way I do them. So I had to plan out a schedule in advance.
