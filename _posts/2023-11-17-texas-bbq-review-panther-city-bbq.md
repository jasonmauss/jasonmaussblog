First established in 2014, [Panther City BBQ](https://www.panthercitybbq.com) has been serving up top quality Texas style BBQ for nearly a decade now. Located in the southern part of Fort Worth, Texas, the quality of their food hit my nose the second I got out of the car about 50 feet away from their giant outdoor offset smokers. The blend of oak and hickory smoke fills the air all around their restaurant and the scents get even better once you're inside the doors. Although if you don't want to spend too much time in line outside, I recommend you get there outside of the lunch or dinner rush times. I got there around 11:30 and the line was almost already at the door.

### Top-Tier Texas BBQ

As someone who has eaten plenty of great BBQ and also makes their own in backyard smokers, Panther City was ticking a lot of boxes for me right off the bat. Their [menu](https://www.panthercitybbq.com/bbq-menu/), which has a great selection of traditional BBQ meats and sides, offers meats by the half-pound, as well as other great options in sandwhich and even burrito form.

### Hell's Half Acre Platter

Coming in at $100, is their platter named **Hell's Half Acre**, which included brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, jalapeño cheddar sausage, and pork belly burnt ends - as well as three medium sides. This is a **large** amount of food - I shared this with 3 other people and we couldn't even finish it all. We also added a large side of their spicy smoked mac & cheese, topped with some sliced jalapeños. My only regret was not having room to try their banana pudding, which looked very tempting.

### Final thoughts

If you're in the Fort Worth area and love BBQ, this place is a must-try. The only thing I could perhaps mark off a  little for is the amount of smoke flavor in their brisket, but that was the only thing I could even be nit-picky about. The pork-belly burnt ends were delicious and almost melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sausage was done right as well, with real cheddar in them, not some cheese sauce or something with an odd flavor and texture to it. The sausage casings were nice and tight too, almost making it difficult to spear with a plastic fork. The pulled pork, just like the brisket, was dripping with juices, and had great bark on it. The mix of salt, rendered fat, and smoke flavors made this trip one to remember. Get there early enough to make it easy to find a seat and enjoy the delicious Texas BBQ.
