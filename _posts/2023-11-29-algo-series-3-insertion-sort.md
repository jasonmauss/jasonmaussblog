The discussion of algorithms continues with the third overall and the second sorting algorithm being covered now - Insertion Sort. Much like bubble sort and selection sort, insertion sort is a simple, easy to understand sorting algorithm that requires very little code to implement. Keep reading to learn how it works and follow along with a code example of how to implement it as well as a discussion of when it might be the ideal sorting algorithm to use in your own code.
