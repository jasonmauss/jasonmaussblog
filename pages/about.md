Hey there, thanks for visiting my website. I'll try to keep this short since I would imagine most people don't have much of an attention span when it comes to learning about me. ;)

I'm originally a California native, hailing from the NorCal's East Bay, specifically Antioch. However, destiny led me to the emerging suburbs of Northwest Phoenix, more precisely, Surprise, Arizona, back in 2006, and I've called this place home ever since. As for my relationship with the scorching Arizona heat, let's just say we've come to a mutual understanding over the years that neither of us will be departing the desert anytime soon.

T﻿he home page banner mentions "Code, Sports, Music, and Texas style BBQ". Let's discuss these things, in that order.

## C﻿ode

My introduction to the world of computer programming dates back to my high school days in 1995. I can still recall my first foray into the realm of True BASIC code on the now-nostalgic Windows 95 platform. It looked something like this:

Back then, the prospect of crafting a Bubble Sort routine seemed as daunting as trying to decipher a foreign language, but my fascination with the subject persevered. Despite my initial struggles, I couldn't help but be captivated by the world of programming. I'd spend countless hours tinkering on my home PC with QBasic on Windows 95. The following year, I enrolled in another programming class, this time delving into code using Borland's Turbo Pascal 4.0. We ventured into creating applications like an address book and honed our understanding of basic data structures

Shortly after high school, I was fortunate to accept an invitation to try a programming job working for an uncle who was involved in Visual Basic programming. This experience opened my eyes to the fascinating possibilities of software development. Little did I know that acquiring computer skills, especially programming, would prove to be an invaluable asset that I could master on my own. 

Fast forward 25 years, and I find myself as a seasoned senior full-stack software engineer. My journey has led me to explore a wide spectrum of technologies, including web, mobile, cloud, and database development, across various platforms and languages. The dynamic nature of this field keeps me continually engaged and eager to expand my knowledge, a challenge that I relish.

## S﻿ports

As I mentioned, my formative years were in the vibrant sports scene of the Bay Area during the 80s and 90s. I immersed myself in playing organized sports year-round, from baseball and basketball to soccer. However, during my high school years, it became tennis that truly captured my heart.

Coming of age in the Bay Area meant rooting for iconic teams: The Oakland A's, San Francisco 49ers, and Golden State Warriors! The Warriors took a while to bring home some championships, but it was worth the wait. While I don't harbor any ill will toward the Raiders, there's an unspoken satisfaction in watching the Raiders' struggles, though as time passes, my animosity towards them has mellowed.

My journey with tennis began as a high school sophomore. I ventured into it without any formal lessons or coaches, simply practicing during the spring season each year. Over time, I honed my skills to the point where I proudly held the #1 Singles position on my high school team. It wasn't until my mid-twenties that I seriously picked up the sport again and started practicing with my own ball machine. I delved even deeper, participating in USTA Leagues at the 4.5 level and exploring various Open level leagues, until a shoulder injury briefly sidelined me.

My passion for tennis has led me to an extensive knowledge of the sport and its professional players. I eagerly follow not only the prestigious Grand Slam events but also the lesser-known tournaments that make up the grueling 11-month tennis season. It's a passion that has stayed with me throughout the years. I've even been lucky enough as an experienced stringer to work seniors tournaments where I strung racquets for Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, John McEnroe and other tennis legends.

## M﻿usic

Music holds a profound place in my life, akin to the core elements that define who I am. From my earliest days, I embraced the world of music, starting with the piano. I explored this instrument from a young age and even ventured into the realm of trumpet playing, dedicating several years to practicing it as well. While my attempts to conquer the guitar and drums remain on the horizon as future hobbies, it's the piano that has seen me journey farthest in terms of skill.

The piano has been my companion on my musical journey, and it's the instrument that I've cultivated most extensively. During my teen years I took my passion for piano beyond the realm of personal enjoyment and embarked on the thrilling challenge of performing classical compositions. Performing the works of esteemed composers like Beethoven, Liszt, Rachmaninov, and others became part of my pursuit, and I proudly showcased their timeless beauty in recitals.

Interestingly, my piano journey also had a surprising side effect - it greatly enhanced my keyboard typing skills. By practicing piano, my fingers became nimble and precise, translating into a typing prowess that had me effortlessly achieving 50+ words per minute in middle school typing tests.

## T﻿exas style BBQ

My journey into the world of Texas style BBQ is a relatively recent one, igniting just a few years ago, around 2021. In this short span, it has evolved from a mere interest into a full-blown obsession. I've immersed myself in the art of BBQ, dedicating countless hours to devouring video content, primarily on YouTube, that unveils the secrets to crafting mouthwatering BBQ dishes. From brisket to pulled pork, pork ribs to beef ribs, sausage to turkey, and an array of delectable sauces, I've delved into the techniques that transform ordinary cuts into extraordinary feasts.

In my backyard, I have my smoker setup, a crucial tool in my quest to master the art of Texas-style BBQ. Among the tantalizing cuts, brisket remains my perennial favorite. Through continuous practice and experimentation, I've honed the skills necessary to achieve that coveted dark bark, a rich smokiness that infuses every bite, and the luxurious rendering of fat, with each slice adorned by a distinctive reddish-pink smoke ring.

Pulled pork, with its succulent tenderness and harmonious blend of flavors, has secured a close second place in my culinary heart. Fortunately, my current work arrangement allows me the privilege of remote employment with a company based in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. This grants me the opportunity to visit their offices from time to time, and in those moments, I make sure to explore the BBQ establishments that Texas is renowned for.

## My Amazing Family

While this may not take center stage on the home page banner, an 'About Me' page wouldn't be complete without acknowledging the wonderful individuals who make up my family. My incredible wife is not only a talented photographer (you can check out her work [here](https://desertmousecreative.com/)), but she's also a culinary magician in the kitchen, known for crafting some of the most mouthwatering tacos you'll ever have the pleasure of savoring.

As for our three children, they've grown into remarkable adults now in their twenties, and we've transitioned into the 'empty-nest' phase of life. Witnessing our kids evolve into outstanding individuals is a true blessing, and we relish every moment we spend with them and their partners whenever our paths cross. Admittedly, we might occasionally sweeten the deal with promises of those delectable tacos or a tantalizing taste of Texas-style BBQ. After all, family gatherings are made even more special with great food and even greater company.
