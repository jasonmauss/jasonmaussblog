Hey there, thanks for visiting my website. I'll try to keep this short since I would imagine most people don't have much of an attention span when it comes to learning about me. ;)

I'm originally a California native, hailing from the NorCal's East Bay, specifically Antioch. However, destiny led me to the emerging suburbs of Northwest Phoenix, more precisely, Surprise, Arizona, back in 2006, and I've called this place home ever since. As for my relationship with the scorching Arizona heat, let's just say we've come to a mutual understanding over the years that neither of us will be departing the desert anytime soon.

T﻿he home page here mentions "Code, Sports, Music, and Texas style BBQ". Let's discuss these things, in that order.

## C﻿ode

My introduction to the world of computer programming dates back to my high school days in 1995. I can still recall my first foray into the realm of True BASIC code on the now-nostalgic Windows 95 platform. It looked something like this:

Back then, the prospect of crafting a Bubble Sort routine seemed as daunting as trying to decipher a foreign language, but my fascination with the subject persevered. Despite my initial struggles, I couldn't help but be captivated by the world of programming. I'd spend countless hours tinkering on my home PC with QBasic on Windows 95. The following year, I enrolled in another programming class, this time delving into code using Borland's Turbo Pascal 4.0. We ventured into creating applications like an address book and honed our understanding of basic data structures

Shortly after high school, I was fortunate to accept an invitation to try a programming job working for an uncle who was involved in Visual Basic programming. This experience opened my eyes to the fascinating possibilities of software development. Little did I know that acquiring computer skills, especially programming, would prove to be an invaluable asset that I could master on my own. 

Fast forward 25 years, and I find myself as a seasoned senior full-stack software engineer. My journey has led me to explore a wide spectrum of technologies, including web, mobile, cloud, and database development, across various platforms and languages. The dynamic nature of this field keeps me continually engaged and eager to expand my knowledge, a challenge that I relish.

## S﻿ports

A﻿s I mentioned, I grew up in the Bay Area in the 80's and 90's and played a lot of organized sports pretty much year-round. Baseball, Basketball, Soccer, and the sport I eventually became completely obsessed with - Tennis. Growing up where I did and when I did: Go A's! Go 49ers! Go Warriors! I have no hate for the Giants really, but I quietly enjoy seeing the Raiders struggle. Although if I'm being honest, I find myself feeling less animosity towards the Raiders as time passes. I first got into Tennis as a sophomore in high school. No lessons or coaches or anything really, just practices during the season. I got good enough to eventually play #1 Singles for my high school team. I didn't really get decent at the sport until I picked it back up again and started practicing with my own ball machine in my early 20's. I eventually ended up playing USTA Leagues (4.5 level) and some other Open level leagues for a while until a shoulder injury sidelined me for a while. I'm about as knowledgeable about the sport and the professional players as one can be and still regularly watch not only the four majors every year, but all the smaller, lesser-known tournaments throughout the insanely long 11 month season every year.

## M﻿usic

M﻿usic is as big a part of my life as anything else so it felt right to give it a place here. I grew up playing piano from a young age, and dabbled in playing the trumpet for several years as well. I've tried several times to try and get better at guitar and the drums, but it's just a future hobby for me these days. Piano is where I went the furthest skills-wise and ended up performing several classical pieces at recitals from composers like Beethoven, Liszt, Rachmaninov, and others. Piano certainly helped with my keyboard typing as well and had me typing at about 50 WPM on the typing tests in middle school!

## T﻿exas style BBQ

T﻿his is a fairly recent one for me. I got bit by the BBQ bug only a couple of years ago (so, about 2021) but it's become kind of an obsession of mine in that short time. I've watched hundreds of hours of video content, mostly on YouTube, about the best methods for cooking delicious BBQ foods including brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, beef ribs, sausage, turkey, and various types of sauces. I have a couple of different smokers in my backyard that I use to practice perfecting the craft of Texas style BBQ. My favorite cut to cook is still brisket, which I've just about perfected getting a really dark bark, a rich smokey flavor, and the juiciest nicely rendered fat with a thick reddish-pink smoke ring on every slice. Pulled pork is probably my second favorite. I'm fortunate to work remotely for a company based in the Dallas/Fort Worth area that I travel to the offices of occasionally and get to hit up BBQ restaurants in the area while I'm visiting.
